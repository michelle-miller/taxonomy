# Possessives

Follow these guidelines for using possessives:

- For most singular nouns, and for plural nouns that do not end in _s_, form the possessive by adding an apostrophe and the letter _s_ (_&rsquo;s_).

- For plural nouns that end in _s_, form the possessive by adding an apostrophe alone.

  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Fine tune the foundation model to customize the model for your use case, and then deploy your tuned foundation model as a new model asset.

## Typographical considerations

You can generate an apostrophe directly through the keyboard, by using tagging in an authoring tool, or by using HTML or unicode characters in the source to produce the right characters in the output.

To follow IBM Design Language best practices, use a curly apostrophe instead of a straight apostrophe where appropriate.

The following table describes the key combinations to use depending on the operating system you&rsquo;re using.

| Character | Unicode representation | Windows | Mac | HTML |
|-----------|-------------------------|----------|-----|-------|
| Apostrophe (&rsquo;) | U+2019 | Alt+0146 | option+shift+] | `&rsquo;` |
