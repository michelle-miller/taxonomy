# Abbreviations

Abbreviations include initialisms, acronyms, and shortened words.
An _initialism_ is an abbreviation that is pronounced as individual letters, for example, IBM. 
An _acronym_ is an abbreviation that forms a pronounceable word, for example, NATO.

## General guidelines

Use an abbreviation in the following situations:

- Its meaning is clear: the spelled-out form is well known or is stated at the first instance in text.
- It makes the information easier to understand.
- It is recognized more easily than its spelled-out form, for example, HTML.
- It reduces text when space is limited, such as in a table or detailed diagram.

Do not use an abbreviation in the following situations:

- It is unnecessary: the spelled-out form is short, clear, and does not benefit from abbreviation.
- It is invented: the abbreviation is created for specific content and does not have widespread use.
- Its meaning is unclear: the spelled-out form is not well known or is not stated at the first instance in text.
- It makes the information more difficult to understand.
- It occurs infrequently in the information, such as only two or three times in a large amount of content.
- It has several possible spelled-out forms, and the variations create confusion.
- It creates an inappropriate or undesirable letter combination or word.
- It is derived from Latin.
- It abbreviates an IBM product name. Legal and branding representatives must officially approve abbreviations for product names, such as RUP or TADDM.
- It abbreviates a name or entity that is owned by another company, and the owning company does not use that abbreviation.
- It might be a registered trademark for a different product or entity.

Follow these general guidelines for abbreviations:

- Do not abbreviate or otherwise abridge text if doing so sacrifices clarity. In the following example, writing both parameter options in full is clearer than saving a little space by referring to both options by using a single term with the prefix in parentheses.

    ![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) Set the (UN)ABRIDGED option of the INFO parameter.<br/>
    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Set the ABRIDGED or UNABRIDGED option of the INFO parameter.

- Choose the indefinite article _a_ or _an_ according to how an abbreviation is spoken. Use _a_ before an abbreviation that begins with a consonant sound. Use _an_ before an abbreviation with a vowel sound. For more information about which indefinite article to use, see [Articles](articles.md).

    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) a PDF document, an SAP project, an XML activity

- If an abbreviation can be plural, form the plural by adding a lowercase _s_. The abbreviation for a unit of measurement is both singular and plural.

    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) user IDs, RFPs, 1 mm, 10 mm

- Do not use an abbreviation as a noun unless the sentence makes sense when you substitute the spelled-out form of the term.

    ![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) The tutorials are available as PDFs. [portable document formats]<br/>
    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) The tutorials are available as PDF files.
  
    ![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) Enhancements in this release include a redesigned GUI.<br/>
    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) The procurement process begins with an RFP.

- Do not use abbreviations as verbs.

    ![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) You can FTP the files to the server.<br/>
    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) You can use the FTP command to send the files to the server.

- Do not use an apostrophe and the letter _s_ (&rsquo;s) to show the possessive form of an abbreviation. Make the abbreviation an adjective, or use the abbreviation in a prepositional phrase.

    ![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) HTML&rsquo;s properties are editable.<br/>
    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) HTML properties are editable.<br/>
    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) The properties of HTML are editable.

- Do not abbreviate a unit of measurement in general text if no numeric value is associated with it.

    ![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) Record the size of the package in mm.<br/>
    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Record the size of the package in millimeters.
   
    ![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) Download times are reduced from 10 ms to less than a ms.<br/>
    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Download times are reduced from 10 ms to less than a millisecond.

- Do not abbreviate a multiplier to a letter, such as “thousand” to K or “million” to M. Use letters only as prefixes to units of measurement, such as “km” for “kilometers” or “MB” for “megabytes”. For correct usage of multiplier prefixes, including k (for x1,000) and K (for x1,024), see [Units of measurement](units-of-measurement.md).

    ![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) The company has 10K employees.<br/>
    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) The company has 10 thousand employees.<br/>
    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) The company has 10,000 employees.
  
    ![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) The contract is worth USD 4M.<br/>
    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) The contract is worth USD 4 million.<br/>
    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) The contract is worth USD 4,000,000.
    
    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Each turbine can generate 30 MW of power.<br/>
    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) The power line is 50 km long.<br/>
    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) The client system has only 100 KB of memory.

    **Exception:** Using an uppercase letter as an abbreviation for a multiplier is allowed when space is limited (as on some user interfaces or websites, and as in some mobile apps), and when readers can be expected to know or easily determine the meaning of the abbreviation. In such instances, do not insert a blank between the number and the multiplier.

    ![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) 100 K visitors/yr.<br/>
    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) 100K visitors/yr.<br/>
    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Sales: $4M

## Spelled-out forms

Follow these guidelines for spelling out abbreviations:

- Do not spell out an abbreviation that is commonly known to the target audience. Commonly known terms vary by audience; each writing and editing team must determine which abbreviations are familiar to the audience.

    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) _When known to the audience:_ DOS, HTML, HTTP, PDF, TCP/IP

- If an abbreviation is not commonly known, or if you are unsure whether it is commonly known, spell out the term at its first occurrence in text, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses. If information has a defined, linear reading path, consider spelling out an abbreviation at its first occurrence in a major section, such as at the beginning of each chapter in a book, or in an overview topic instead of in each subtopic. See specific guidance for [Videos](videos.md).

    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) massively parallel processing (MPP)<br/>
    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) minimum recovery time (MRT)<br/>
    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) customer service representative (CSR)

- Confirm the capitalization for the spelled-out form of an abbreviation; many spelled-out abbreviations do not require initial uppercase letters. 

  <span class="carbon-tag-blue">IBM only</span> To confirm the capitalization, first search for the term in the [IBM Terminology database ![link to IBM proprietary content](images/launch-ibm.png)](https://w3.terminology.g11n.ibm.com/standards/terminology/termsearch). The database is not exhaustive, so you might also have to search the internet. If you find instances of the spelled-out form with initial lowercase letters in reliable sources, use that capitalization because IBM Style prefers a lowercase style.

    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) graphical user interface (GUI)<br/>
    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) local area network (LAN)<br/>
    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) service-oriented architecture (SOA)

- Most spelled-out forms of language and protocol names have initial uppercase letters.

    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)<br/>
    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Unified Modeling Language (UML)<br/>
    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Web Services Description Language (WSDL)<br/>
    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Wireless Application Protocol (WAP)

- When you spell out an abbreviation, do not capitalize letters in the middle of a word to show the origin of an initialism.

    ![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) eXtensible markup language (XML)<br/>
    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Extensible Markup Language (XML)

- In most cases, when you spell out an abbreviation, do not include wording that repeats part of the spelled-out version of the abbreviation. For example, do not use _DASD device_, because the second _D_ stands for _device_, or _JCL language_, because the _L_ stands for _language_. However, there are rare exceptions. For example, it is standard to refer to a _CICS system_, although _CICS_ stands for _Customer Information Control System_.

## Periods with abbreviations

Follow these guidelines for using periods with abbreviations:

- Omit periods in uppercase abbreviations.

    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) EST, ID, US

- Omit periods in abbreviations for academic degrees.

    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) BA, MA, PhD

- Include periods in abbreviations for social titles.

    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Dr., Ms., Jr.

- If an abbreviation that requires a period occurs at the end of a sentence, do not include another period.

    ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) In American system units, the dimensions are 4 in. x 6 in. x 12 in.

For guidance about using periods with abbreviated units of measurement, see [Units of measurement](units-of-measurement.md#abbreviations).

## Glossaries

For the abbreviation, provide a _See_ reference that points to the spelled-out term; do not provide a definition.

![Correct example](images/preferred.png) **DBCS**

See double-byte character set.

For the spelled-out term, provide a definition; do not provide a _See_ reference to the abbreviation. 
Put the abbreviated term in parentheses after the spelled-out term.

![Correct example](images/preferred.png) **double-byte character set (DBCS)**

A set of characters in which each character is represented by 2 bytes.

## Headings and titles

Avoid using abbreviations in headings and titles unless an abbreviation is well known or the spelled-out form is too long. 
If you use an abbreviation for the first time in a heading or title, ensure that you include the spelled-out form either in the heading or title or in the text that immediately follows the heading or title. See also [Headings](headings.md).

![Correct example](images/preferred.png) **Creating Unified Modeling Language diagrams**

You can use Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams to model complex systems.

![Correct example](images/preferred.png) **Creating UML diagrams**

You can use Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams to model complex systems.

![Correct example](images/preferred.png) **Creating Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams**

You can use UML diagrams to model complex systems.

## Indexes

For abbreviations that are unambiguous and that are recognized more easily than their spelled-out forms, index only the abbreviations. 
Examples are _AIX, CORBA, HTML, SQL, PDF, XML, TCP/IP_, and _UNIX_.

![Correct example](images/preferred.png) `<i1>AIX`

For other abbreviations, create main entries for both the abbreviation and the spelled-out form. 
Place the secondary and tertiary entries under the abbreviation. 
Under the spelled-out form, place a _See_ reference to the abbreviation.

![Correct example](images/preferred.png)

`<i1>ECI`<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;`<i2>requests`<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;`<i2>security`<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;`<i2>transaction IDs`<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;`<i2>transaction IDs`<br/>
`<i1>External Call Interface`<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;`<i2>See ECI`<br/>

## Latin abbreviations

Do not use Latin abbreviations; use their English equivalents instead. 
Latin abbreviations are sometimes misunderstood.

| **Latin** | **English equivalent** |
|-----------|------------------------|
| e.g.      | Use _for example_.     |
| etc.      | Use _and so on_ when you list a clear sequence of elements, such as &ldquo;1, 2, 3, and so on&rdquo; or &ldquo;Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and so on&rdquo;. Otherwise, rewrite the sentence to replace _etc._ with something more descriptive, such as &ldquo;and other output&rdquo;. |
| i.e.      | Use _that is_.         |

## Legal considerations

If you create an abbreviation, check with your Intellectual Property Law (IPL) department before you use it. 
Your IPL department must verify that abbreviations are not trademarks of other companies. 
Do not use abbreviations for terms if the abbreviations are trademarks of other companies.

Do not create an abbreviation that is the same as an IBM trademark but that has a different meaning. 
For example, do not use _AFS_ as an abbreviation for _advanced file system_. _AFS_ is a trademark of IBM.

For legal reasons, do not use abbreviations on front covers unless they are IBM trademarks.
