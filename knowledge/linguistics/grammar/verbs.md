## General guidelines

Keep verbs clear and concise:

- Avoid using words that primarily function as verbs as nouns or adjectives. Verbs that are commonly misused as nouns or adjectives include _configure_, _compile_, _debug_, _fix_, and _install_.

  ![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) after the compile<br/>
  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) after the compilation

  ![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) the debug function<br/>
  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) the debugging function

  ![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) during the install<br/>
  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) during the installation

- Avoid using a phrasal verb (a verb and a preposition) if the verb alone provides the same meaning.

  ![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) call up<br/>
  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) call

  ![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) click on<br/>
  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) click

  ![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) print out<br/>
  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) print

  ![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) start up<br/>
  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) start

- When you write a sentence that includes two coordinate clauses, do not omit the verb from the second clause.

  ![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) The file names are displayed in uppercase characters and the other file attributes in lowercase characters.<br/>
  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) The file names are displayed in uppercase characters, and the other file attributes are displayed in lowercase characters.

- When you use a verb phrase at the beginning of a sentence with a present participle, such as _creating_, or a past participle, such as _created_, make sure that the verb phrase modifies the correct word. Failure to do so results in a dangling modifier.

  ![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) Having configured your environment, the program is ready to be used.<br/>
  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) After you configure your environment, you can use the program.

  ![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) Cleared of the corrupted data, you can now repopulate the repository.<br/>
  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) After you clear the corrupted data, you can repopulate the repository.

## Mood

Use the appropriate mood for the information type:

- Use the imperative mood for requests or instructions, such as in procedures.

  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Before you install the product, back up your files.<br/>
  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Select one or more checkboxes.

- Use the indicative mood to specify information, such as facts and explanations.

  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) The product provides a powerful way to store information.<br/>
  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) The computer cancels the action and stops all processing.

- Do not use the subjunctive mood in technical documentation.

  ![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) If you were to save the file ...<br/>
  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) If you save the file ...

  ![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) It is important that the file be saved ...<br/>
  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Important: Save the file ...

## Person

Use the appropriate person for the information type.

### First person

Avoid using first person, which is indicated by the personal pronouns _I_, _me_, _my_, _we_, _us_, and _our_. 
The first person focuses on the writer, not on the audience or the information being presented. 
See specific guidance for [Videos](videos.md). 
The first person can also contribute to an overly informal tone and cause confusion over whether the writing represents an individual, group, or IBM as a company. See [Personal pronouns](pronouns.md?view=kc#personal-pronouns).

![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) I find some servers more difficult to configure.<br/>
![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Some servers can be more difficult to configure.

![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) Let&rsquo;s start by planning the home page for the website.<br/>
![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Start by planning the home page for the website.

![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) We can add a model to the project that we created in the previous step.<br/>
![Correct example](images/preferred.png) You can add a model to the project that you created in the previous step.

![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) We are offering you a 15 percent discount for this IBM event.<br/>
![Correct example](images/preferred.png) You are eligible for a 15 percent discount for this IBM event.

The use of first person is acceptable in these situations:

- In the question portion of frequently asked questions (FAQs).

  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Q: How do I change the properties of a class?

- In articles, white papers, marketing proposals, or documents with one or more authors and in which the author or authors describe their own actions or opinions.

  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) I look forward to meeting you at this year&rsquo;s technical symposium.

- In videos, if it adds value to the content or if the presenters are visible. In these cases, the presenters may introduce themselves but should not use the first person elsewhere in the video.

### Second person

As much as possible, use the second person, which is indicated by the personal pronoun _you_. 
The second person focuses on the reader.

![Correct example](images/preferred.png) When you create a database, you must provide a unique name.

To instruct the user to perform an action, use the imperative mood. 
The subject of an imperative sentence is understood to be _you_.

![Correct example](images/preferred.png) To begin processing, press Enter.

### Third person

Use the third person to describe concepts, facts, and results. 
The third person focuses on the information being presented. 
Most often, technical information is about things, not people. 
Therefore, the third person is indicated by nouns and third-person pronouns such as _it_ and _they_. 
When you use the third person, do not use gender-specific pronouns, such as _he_ and _she_, unless the context requires them. 
For details, see [Gender-neutral pronouns](pronouns.md?view=kc#gender-neutral-pronouns).

![Correct example](images/preferred.png) The first three exercises show how to build complex models.<br/>
![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Specify whether users can add themselves to a project.<br/>
![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Peter recorded his test results in a spreadsheet program.

## Subject-verb agreement

Follow the basic grammar rules for subject-verb agreement: a subject and its verb must agree in number and person. 
Use these guidelines to make subjects and verbs agree in more complex situations:

- Subjects joined by _and_ usually take plural verbs.

  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Government and healthcare are key target markets for smarter software.

    _Exception:_ When the parts of the subject form a single idea or refer to a single person or thing, they take a singular verb.

  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Sales and marketing is the biggest expense for the product.

    _Exception:_ When the adjective _each_ or _every_ precedes a compound subject, the verb is usually singular.

  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Each manager and employee receives an annual performance review.<br/>
  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Every sample and tutorial is edited according to the guidelines.

- When subjects are joined by _or_ or _nor_, the verb agrees with the subject that is closer.

  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Neither service nor support is included with the basic contract.<br/>
  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Either the editor or the writers run the grammar-checking tool.<br/>
  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) The user name, password, or both are not valid.

- Collective nouns usually are treated as singular entities, and take a matching verb. Some collective nouns can be used commonly as plural, so it is acceptable to write, “The staff are arriving”. However, where the collective noun seems more natural as a plural, as in when group members act separately, be as clear as possible and use a modifer to make the noun and verb agree elegantly.

  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) This afternoon, the team presents its findings.<br/>
  ![Use with caution](images/caution.png) The staff are arriving.<br/>
  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) The staff members are arriving.<br/>
  ![Do not use](images/dont-use.png) Each morning, the team discuss their preferences.<br/>
  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) The team players discuss their preferences.<br/>
  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) IBM announces its quarterly results promptly.<br/>

## Tense

Write in the simple present tense as much as possible.

![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) When you open the latch, the panel will slide forward.<br/>
![Correct example](images/preferred.png) When you open the latch, the panel slides forward.

Use past or future tense only when you cannot use present tense or it does not make sense to use present tense.

![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) If you selected **New** in the previous window, the current window will display the default values.<br/>
![Correct example](images/preferred.png) If you selected **New** in the previous window, the current window displays the default values.

Do not use future tense in a cause and effect sentence, but you can use it for valid future situations.

![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Certification testing will be available at the next Think conference.

## Voice

<span class="carbon-tag-green">LLM helper</span> Use active voice as much as possible. Active voice focuses on the performer of the action and is often clearer, shorter, and more direct than passive voice.

![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) _Passive:_ The Limits window is used to specify the minimum and maximum values.<br/>
![Correct example](images/preferred.png) _Active:_ In the Limits window, specify the minimum and maximum values.

![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) _Passive:_ Up to 500 files can be stored in the database.<br/>
![Correct example](images/preferred.png) _Active:_ You can store up to 500 files in the database.

Passive voice is acceptable when any of these conditions are true:

- The system performs the action.<br/>
- It is more appropriate to focus on the receiver of the action.<br/>
- You want to avoid blaming the user for an error, such as in an error message.<br/>
- The information is clearer in passive voice.<br/>
- Specific information types, such as glossary definitions, require passive voice.

  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) The file is saved when you press Enter.<br/>
  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) When you use the recover command, any lost data is recovered.<br/>
  ![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Error: An incorrect value was entered.
