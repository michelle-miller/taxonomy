# Articles

Articles increase clarity and ease translation. 

The articles “a” and “an” are indefinite articles. Use them to refer to things in the abstract or not in the particular. “An offering” or “a product” means any offering or any product, as opposed to a specific offering or product. 

“The” is a definite article. Use it to refer to a particular thing or things, meaning that “the offering” or “the product” is about that particular offering or product.

Do not omit an article that belongs in a sentence to save space because the omission creates a sentence that sounds stilted and unnatural.

![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) File cannot be found. <br/>

![Correct example](images/preferred.png) *Refers to any object*: Delete an object from the editor. <br/>
![Correct example](images/preferred.png) *Refers to a specific object that was discussed previously*: Delete the object from the editor.
  
In some cases, articles can be omitted. For example, you can omit the article from a sentence that expresses a general sentiment.

![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) The servers talk to the clients.<br/>
![Correct example](images/preferred.png) Servers talk to clients.

For more information about when to keep or omit articles, refer to a grammar tutorial, such as [When to Use 'A,' 'An,' or 'The'](https://gallaudet.edu/student-success/tutorial-center/english-center/grammar-and-vocabulary/when-to-use-a-an-or-the/).


## When to use *a* or *an*
Choose the indefinite article _a_ or _an_ according to how an abbreviation, word, or number is spoken.

If an abbreviation is pronounced as a series of letters, choose the article according to the pronunciation of the first letter. 
If an abbreviation is pronounced as a word, choose the article according to the pronunciation of the word. 
Assume that the period in a file name extension, such as .exe, is pronounced as _dot_, and use the indefinite article _a_.

Use _a_ before an abbreviation, word, or number that begins with a consonant sound.

| **Takes the article _a_** | **Consonant sound** |
|---------------------------|---------------------|
| ``.mbtest`` file              | D, as in _dot_      |
| historical                | H, as in _hit_      |
