## (s)

Do not use the letter _s_ in parentheses _(s)_ to indicate that a noun can be singular or plural. 
Some languages form plural nouns differently than English, and the construction _(s)_ can cause translation problems. 
Instead, use the plural form or, if it is important to indicate both singular and plural options, use _one or more_.

_(When there is a one-to-many relationship between the subject and object)_

![Incorrect example](images/dont-use.png) Baskets can have owners.<br>

_(When there is a zero-to-one or one-to-one relationship between the subject and object)_<br>
